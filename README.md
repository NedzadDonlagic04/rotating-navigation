# rotating-navigation

The goal of this project was to make a rotating
navigation, once a button was clicked it would
reveal the navigation options and when clicked
again it would hide them.
While doing this project I managed to practice
basic html,css,javascript as well as the use
of vite.js.
This was done following the Udemy 50 Projects 
in 50 Days course.
The production version of this project can be
found onn the gh-pages branch of this repo.
